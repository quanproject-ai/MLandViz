**Battery Visualization**
This application provides customizable plotting using boxplots for grouping batteries as quality control check. Also, it provides a 7 differen plots to visualize the entire raw metrics during battery cycling.

**Machine Learning Applications**
Supervised Machine Learning: This application provides a template for preprocessing data, model selection (regressions, characterization, clusters) and model tuning using either one parameter at a time to understand the impact or built-in function of scikit-learn (RandomsearchCV or GridSearchCV)
